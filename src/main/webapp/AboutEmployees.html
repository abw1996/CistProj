Here Jason Maine had the pleasure of crafting new hair styles for such diverse A-list stars as Roger Daltrey, Mariel Hemmingway, Lil' Kim and Stevie Nicks among many others. 
 
While working with celebrities is always exciting, Jason Maine finds that he most enjoys working with the professional woman that possesses a strong sense of self and understanding of her own unique flair.  Collaborating with his clients to create a beautiful expression of their personal style while incorporating a polished and sophisticated look, results in the ultimate realization of his artistry.
